<article>
<p>This week in SDI, I will be continuing my time travel story.  I believe this will be ideal for some of the objectives covered this week, as it gives me a great narrative for executing loops.'</p>
<p>This week my protagonist (and my code) attempts to travel through time, and argues whether or not he has found himself in a time paradox.
<p>The focus of this week's assignment is to demonstrate functions, and the ability to pass values into a function, and return values out.'</p>
