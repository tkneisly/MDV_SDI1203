<article>
<p>For my week 3 assignment, I explore the course material for understanding JavaScript Objects, as well as JSON data structures.</p>
<p>I accomplish this by using data that can be assigned to classes that can be used by my object.  In this case, the object is the time machine, (or the Delorean), and my classes of other objects being used by the Delorean are the different drivers, and the times visted by the Delorean.</p>
<p>I also explore other capabilities of objects, such as using methods to rearrange, or mutate, values within the object</P>
